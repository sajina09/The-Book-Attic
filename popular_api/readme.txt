THIS IS NOT COMPLETE SERVER BUT ONLY API FOR FRONEND WHICH IS BEING HANDLED BY MR.THAPA

Running the code:

Installing requirements
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
>> python manage.py makemigrations 
>> python manage.py migrate
>> python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Backend server will run in port 8000


Things still reamaining to maintain
1. >> dest_file is not consistent and depends on origin of requests

This can be run under docker and docker compose 
Install docker-compose on your machine 
run docker-compose up on the machine
This will run the backend server automatially on port 8000
